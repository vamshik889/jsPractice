//Javascripts have the equivalent objects for each of the premitive data type
let str = "Vamshi";

console.log(str.length)  //as the String is premitive still we can use the .length property because JS converts it into equivalent object, 
                           //so we can use length property of the object string 
                           //here object is created for fraction of seconds to make this length property work
