let variable;
console.log(variable);  //undefined

let v2 = null;
console.log(v2);

//difference b/w undefined and null is - undefined means some variable is declared but not defined or assigned any value.
//if we declare a variable and not assigned anything , by default JS assigns undefined to it.
//null is we are explicitly assigning it . eg : var middleName = null;
